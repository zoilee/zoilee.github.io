이번에 재밌게 놀다왔습니다.
기분이 좋습니다.
다음에도 가고싶습니다.

#### 중요한 몇 가지 사실

1. ** 중요한 것은 사랑이 아닐까요.
2. ** 사람은 악하게 태어난다 믿기에 교육 또한 중요하겠지요.
3. ** 악인을 사랑하는것은 차마 할 수 없습니다.

Keep you in the dark

You know they all pretend

Keep you in the dark

And so it all began

Send in your skeletons

Sing as their bones come marchin' in again

The need you buried deep

The secrets that you keep are at the ready

Are you ready?

I'm finished making sense

Done pleading ignorance, that whole defense

Spinning infinity, but

The wheel is spinning me, it's never-ending, never-ending

Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others?

What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?

You're the pretender

What if I say I will never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others?

What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?

You're the pretender

What if I say I will never surrender?

In time, or so I'm told

I'm just another soul for sale, oh well

The page is out of print

We are not permanent, we're temporary, temporary

Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others?

What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?

You're the pretender

What if I say I will never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others?

What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?

You're the pretender

What if I say I will never surrender? Oh

I'm the voice inside your head you refuse to hear

I'm the face that you have to face, mirroring your stare

I'm what's left, I'm what's right, I'm the enemy

I'm the hand that'll take you down, bring you to your knees

So, who are you?

Yeah, who are you?

Yeah, who are you?

Yeah, who are you?


Keep you in the dark

You know they all pretend

What if I say I'm not like the others?

What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?

You're the pretender

What if I say I will never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others?

What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?

You're the pretender

What if I say I will never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others? (Keep you in the dark)

What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays? (You know they all)

You're the pretender (pretend)

What if I say I will never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others? (Keep you in the dark)

What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays? (You know they all)

You're the pretender (pretend)

What if I say I will never surrender?

So, who are you?

Yeah, who are you?

Yeah, who are you?
